# GroundHogDay
The legend behind Groundhog Day tradition goes likes this:
Thousands gather at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, on the second day of February to await the spring forecast from a groundhog known as Punxsutawney Phil. According to legend, if Phil sees his shadow the United States is in store for six more weeks of winter weather. But, if Phil doesn’t see his shadow, the country should expect warmer temperatures and the arrival of an early spring.

The p-value of .217 with no real relationship between them. This 21.7% chance outweighs the .05 significance level, so the correlation is not statistically significant. On the other hand, with 10 points, we have (almost) a 0% chance that we’re wrong about a correlation between X and Y, and thus it is statistically significant.
